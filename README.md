### 👋 Who Am I?

I’m **Dr. Bharat Kwatra**, a Computational Precision Oncologist, Translational Ai and Genomic Consultant and TechBio innovator with 6+ years of experience bridging **oncogenomics, AI systems, Translation bioinformatics, Single and Spatial analysis and Patient-centric innovation**.

🔬 **Current Roles**:
- **Head of Genomics & AI @ RareCan (UK)**
- **Visiting Researcher @ Newcastle University (cfDNA + Variant Matching)**
- **Global Precision Oncology Consultant & Speaker**

💡 I’m building the next generation of **AI-powered decision support tools** in oncology — integrating **clinical data, genomics, and generative AI** to make precision medicine *smarter, faster, and more inclusive*.

### 🔭 What I Build

🚀 **LLM Agents for Oncology**
- Chain-of-thought agents that parse trials, flag ambiguity, and simulate tumor board logic.
- JSON schema-enforced output with confidence scoring.

🧬 **Custom NGS & PGx Pipelines**
- Reproducible workflows via Snakemake + GATK + VEP + COSMIC.
- Fully Apple Silicon–optimized, parallelized, and Dockerized.

📄 **Structured Trial Parsing**
- Converts unstructured eligibility criteria to atomic JSON entries.
- Classifies by arms, subprotocols, I/E flags, and flags “data needed.”

💡 **Real-time Clinical NLP**
- From raw case notes → trial candidates + missing data triggers.
- GPT-4 + FAISS + BM25 hybrid retrieval + LangChain.

📊 **Personalized Dosage Engine**
- BioInCURA: Drug–gene–variant database for PGx-driven dosage optimization.

---

### 🧠 Research Problems I'm Exploring

- 🔍 How can LLMs reduce ambiguity in clinical trial eligibility at scale?
- 🧬 Can we simulate “virtual patient trajectories” across multi-omics inputs?
- 🤖 How do we align AI-generated trial matches with real-world physician decision-making?
- 📈 Can AI agents autonomously flag toxic dosing or missing biomarkers?
- 🧠 How to unify structured patient data + free-text notes + PDFs into usable decision support?
